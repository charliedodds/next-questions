This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

Next 14 requires at least Node version 18

## Start project

`cd` into the repository and install dependencies `npm i`. Run the project locally with `npm run dev` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notes

Minimal styles were added as this was not a focus.

Next was used for personal preference and developer experience

No state management or form libraries used to keep everything simple.
